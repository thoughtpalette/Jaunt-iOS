iOS Application for Field Trip Manager

## Ideas
* app that will store all of their information for easy access and keep track of their attendance

* click their own phone to sign in when they're on the bus or I could ping them with my phone to tell them to come to the bus

* they also have to look at maps and assignments as we walk around so they could have files to look at while we walk

* then they could take pics and save them with the question number so they have a reference for later when they complete the assignment

* there would have to be some online wizard for students to fill out forms and teachers to input assignment questions
